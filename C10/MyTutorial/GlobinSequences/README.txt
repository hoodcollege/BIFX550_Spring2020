Sequences were taken from the book
These are Myoglobin sequences for Phylogenetic analysis

What are these sequences?
MY sequences collected from NCBI and the names were edited to be 
shorter. All sequences were edited to make sure to begin with ATG and end
with TGA/TAG.

Steps to create a tree using MEGA

1) start MEGA
2) Align --> Alignment editor --> Create a new Alignment and choose DNA option for new alignment
3) Edit --> Insert sequences from File and choose the file (fasta)
4) Alignment using ClustalW
5) See the alignment is not good 
6) Let us do the alignment outside of MEGA
7) use MAFFT from EBI 
  https://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/msa/mafft/
8) play withe input options 
9) Save the output in fasta format,  MYODnaCodingAllignedSeq.fasta
10) Repeat the steps (1-3) 
11) dont do the alignment in MEGA
12) save the alignment in MEGA format
13) explore the alignment
14) Go on to Phylogenetic analysis 
15) NJ tree with def options 
16) repeat tree building with Boostrap options to get a confidence in the trees


HINTS to avoid frustrations:

a) dont do the alignments in MEGA
b) Make sure you count the # of sequences in your file and after you 
read them in MEGA, delete extra blank sequences

Questions 

Which species are most closely related? 
why do think human and chimp are closely related species ?
What is your bootstrap confidence?
