Create Figure 7.7 (please note that this instructions are for Mega 7; you may see small changes for Mega X)
1) open Mega
2) Align -> Edit/Build New alignment --> Create New ALignment
3) Are you building DNA/Protein sequence alignments?    Say DNA
4) From the Alignment Editor --> Web --> NCBI session will be opened -->      type the following IDs           NM_000518  XM_508242  NM_016956  NM_001270884      When the hits are displayed, select them all 
    Change the display format from Summary to "Fasta (text)"   When all the fasta sequences are displayed,  Click "Add to Alignment" (red plusbutton) 
5) This will load the sequences into Mega.
6) Align them using default option in Mega
7) Go to Edit--> select all
8) Go to Alignment and --> Alignment by CLustalW (default options)
9) Save the alignemnt by Export the "Date --> Export ALignment --> Mega" 
10) Close the session
11) Read the alignemtn back agin and view the alignment in viewing editor
