Agenda for class C9

* Discuss mid-term format
* Check out the ongoing assignment, bifx550b (avilable from Blackboard). We will discuss the deadline in the class
* Look ahead what is coming and plan for ongoing assignments deadlines
* Multiple sequence alignments (lecture and hands-on)

I have uploaded a long version but I will use a shorter version (upload on the day of the class) for the class. Solved problems for chapter 6 will be avilable from the Blackboard.
