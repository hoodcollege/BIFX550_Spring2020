Agenda for Class-5

We started exploring NCBI/Ensembl (check the hands-on for NCBI in my github page) 
in the last class. In this class, we will focus on Ensembl and UniProt databases. 
Whenever there is a link that takes us back to NCBI, we will cover that as well.

Please note the notes are just summary headings. We will explore them 
in detail in the class. We will spend roughly an hour on the database and then move over to the 
sequence comparison class. Class notes are available in the Github and Blackboard. 

Our focus is going to be CBL (human) gene. 

Ensembl is a project based at the European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI) that provides
annotation for Chordate genomes (vertebrates and closely related invertebrates (ex 
seq squirt)

1) Explore Home page 
   focus on Tools
            Search bar
            "All genomes drop-down" 
            News & information 
            How-tos 
            "View in archive site"
            "View full list of all Ensembl species"

2)   Click on Human
      Explore the site 
      Chromosome summary 
      GC Repeats Variations Summary of genes

3)    Previous assembly 


4)  Visit   ensemblgenomes.org  
     for taxon specific pages

5)  Explore  bacteria specific page

       Search for a species:  Clostridioides difficile 630
       
6) Go back to Ensembl 
   type CBL

7)  Explore the left-hand side menu

Here are some definitions (taken from Ensembl)

Promoters (regions at the 5' end of genes where transcription factors and RNA polymerase bind to initiate transcription)
Promoter flanking regions (transcription factor binding regions that flank the above)
Enhancers (regions that bind transcription factors and interact with promoters to stimulate transcription of distant genes)
CTCF binding sites (regions that bind CTCF, the insulator protein that demarcates open and closed chromatin)
Transcription factor binding sites (sites which bind transcription factors, for which no other role can be determined as yet)
Open chromatin regions (regions of spaced out histones, making them accessible to protein interactions)


Gene Page
    Explore the graphics page
    Configure menu for Tracks ; add and remove tracks (ex LOVD variants)
    Show how to share the page with collaborators
    Explore sequence in GENE tab to show overlapping exons    
    Explore GO ontology
    External references (back to NCBI; uniprot)
    Gene expression 
    Pathway 
    Regulation (Start with CBL but explore BPTF gene which has more experimental info)
      a) (look at the Promoter, Promoter flanks, CTCF binding sites, 
       Enhancers, lilac TF binding sites) 
      b) Zoom in and select the promoter 
      	http://www.ensembl.org/Homo_sapiens/Regulation/Summary?db=core;fdb=funcgen;g=ENSG00000110395;r=11:119196132-119234046;rf=ENSR00000045742;t=ENST00000264033
      c) Click on Source data to see what cells the gene is active on?
      d) At the moment the page is not displaying any data as we haven’t chosen any
cell types. Click on Configure Cell/Tissue to add more to the view.

    Comparative Genomics
    Gene trees and homologs (more on this later)
    Orthologs and paralogs
    

Genes and transcripts
    What transcript to choose
    Go into the reliable transcript and explore the tabs on the left
    AND all the tabs on the left

We will return to NCBI to finish up the following databases.

NCI Gene
  Structures
  ClinVar 
  PubMed
  protein (extract patterns)
    Domain 
  OMIM
  ClinVar

Finally, a quick stop at UniProt before we start discussing the sequence comparison
