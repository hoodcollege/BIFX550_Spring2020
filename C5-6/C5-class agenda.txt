Agenda for Class-5

We started exploring NCBI/Ensembl (check the hands-on for NCBI in my github page) 
in the last class. In this class, we will focus on Ensembl and UniProt databases. 
Whenever there is a link that takes us back to NCBI, we will cover that as well.

Please note the notes are just summary headings. We will explore them 
in detail in the class. 

Our focus is going to be CBL (human) gene. 

Ensembl is a project based at the European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI) that provides
annotation for Chordate genomes (vertebrates and closely related invertebrates (ex 
seq squirt)

1) Explore Home page 
   focus on Tools
            Search bar
            "All genomes drop-down" 
            News & information 
            How-tos 
            "View in archive site"
            "View full list of all Ensembl species"

2)   Click on Human
      Explore the site 

3)    Previous assembly 


4)  Visit   ensemblgenomes.org  
     for taxon specific pages

5)  Explore  bacteria specific page

       Search for a species:  Clostridioides difficile 630
       
6) Go back to Ensembl 
   type CBL

7)  Explore the left-hand side menu

Gene Page
    Explre the graphics page
    Configure menu for Tracks ; add and remove tracks (ex LOVD variants)
    Show how to share the page with collaborators
    Explore sequence in GENE tab to show overlapping exons    
    Explore GO ontology
    External references (back to NCBI; uniprot)
    Gene expression 
    Pathway 
    Regulation (Start with CBL but explore BPTF gene which has more experimental info)
      a) (look at the Promoter, Promoter flanks, CTCF binding sites, 
       Enhancers, lilac TF binding sites) 
      b) Zoom in and select the promoter 
      	http://www.ensembl.org/Homo_sapiens/Regulation/Summary?db=core;fdb=funcgen;g=ENSG00000110395;r=11:119196132-119234046;rf=ENSR00000045742;t=ENST00000264033
      c) Click on Source data to see what cells the gene is active on?
      d) At the moment the page is not displaying any data as we haven’t chosen any
cell types. Click on Configure Cell/Tissue to add more to the view.

    Comparative Genomics
    Gene trees and homologs (more on this later)
    Orthologs and paralogs
Gene CPG 
     Region in detail --> Turn on CPG and also turn on "empty tracks" to show that CPG is not available    

Genes and transcripts
    What transcript to choose
    Go into the reliable transcript and explore the tabs on the left
    AND all the tabs on the left

   

Tools
