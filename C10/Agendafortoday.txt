a) Answer any questions about mid-term or anything else

b) Keep in mind that understanding Molecular phylogeny need a strong mathametical 
    background that is not required for BIFX550. So, here, I will provide a short summary of 
    molecular phylogeny (ShortSummary-Phylogeny.pptx) with minimal math equations. The PPTX is
    available from Github C10 folder

c) Will do some tutorial.
    Mega and other tools.
    Note Mega is a good Phylogeny software but can frustrate Mega X beginners. Practice can help you get over 
    this hurdle.
